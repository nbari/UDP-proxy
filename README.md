# UDP-proxy

**UDP-proxy**, listens on an UDP port (default :1514) and forwards the traffic
via TCP or UDP to a remote host.

Why ?
=====

Because of the need to have logs per application, stored and rotated on the same
host besides been also been available to send the logs to a remote host, helping
with this the centralization/unification of logs from multiple applications but
still continue debugging locally.


Use case
========

[runit](http://smarden.org/runit/)/[svlogd](http://smarden.org/runit/svlogd.8.html) + [papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com/)

runit is used to keep up and running the application, while keeping logs
in ``log/main/current`` but at the same time is required to send logs to
papertrail.

To do this, ``svlogd`` needs a Config file located in ``log/main/config``
directory, contents of the file could be something like:

    s1000000
    n10
    N5
    t86400
    u127.0.0.1:1514

Notice the last line ``u127.0.0.1:1514``, from the svlogd.8 man page:

```text
ua.b.c.d[:port]
tells svlogd to transmit the first len characters of selected log messages to
the IP address a.b.c.d, port number port. If port isnâ€™t set, the default port
for syslog is used (514). len can be set through the -l option, see below. If
svlogd has trouble sending udp packets, it writes error messages to the log
directory. Attention: logging through udp is unreliable, and should be used in
private networks only.
```

Setting **UDP-proxy** to forward logs to **papertrail** is straight forward:

    UDP-proxy -r logs.papertrailapp.com:61653 -f

This will start **UDP-proxy** listening on port ``127.0.0.1:1514`` and forward via
TCP all request to ``logs.papertrailapp.com:61653``.


DNS proxy
=========

To proxy all request to dns.watch:

    UDP-proxy -b 127.0.0.1:5253 -r resolver1.dns.watch:53

Test the proxy using dig:

    dig @127.0.0.1 -p 5253 github.com mx

Iperf
=====

Listen on localhost port 5001:

    UDP-proxy -r localhost:5001 -d

Run iperf server:

    iperf -s -u

Connect the client:

    iperf -u -c 127.0.0.1 -p 1514 -d
