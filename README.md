# UDP-proxy

**UDP-proxy**, listen on an UDP port (default 1514) and forwards the traffic to a
TCP or UDP host.

Why ?
=====

Because of the need to have logs per application, stored and rotated on the same
host besides been also been available to send the logs to a remote host, helping
with this the centralization/unification of logs from multiple applications but
still continue debugging locally.


Use case
========

[runit](http://smarden.org/runit/)/[svlogd](http://smarden.org/runit/svlogd.8.html) + [papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com/)

runit is using to keep up and running the application, while keeping logs in ``log/main/current`` but at the same time is required to send logs to papertrail.

To do this, ``svlogd`` needs a Config file located in ``log/main/config`` directory, contents of the file could be something like:

    s1000000
    n10
    N5
    t86400
    u127.0.0.1:1514

Notice the last line ``u127.0.0.1:1514``, from the svlogd.8 man page:

```text
ua.b.c.d[:port]
tells svlogd to transmit the first len characters of selected log messages to
the IP address a.b.c.d, port number port. If port isnâ€™t set, the default port
for syslog is used (514). len can be set through the -l option, see below. If
svlogd has trouble sending udp packets, it writes error messages to the log
directory. Attention: logging through udp is unreliable, and should be used in
private networks only.
```

Setting **UDP-proxy** to forward logs to **papertrail** is straight forward:

    UDP-proxy -f logs.papertrailapp.com:61653

This will start **UDP-proxy** listening on port ``127.0.0.1:1514`` and forward via
TCP all request to ``logs.papertrailapp.com:61653``.



Testing
=======

You can use the included test client ``client/main`` and
[netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat) to receive the
requests, first start **UDP-proxy**:

    UDP-proxy -f localhost:9090 -d

Next netcat to keep listening on port 9090:

    nc -lk 9090

And at the end start the client:

    $ cd client
    $ go run main.go
